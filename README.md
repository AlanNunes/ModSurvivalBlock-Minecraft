# Survival Block Mod for Minecraft.
When the mod starts, it creates a **place surrounded by walls with a glass floor**. 
But in the floor have different blocks, **find it and stand there**, because the glasses block are going to fade away. 
In the beginning is displayed in the chat that the game is going to start in 30 seconds. 
The only chance to remain alive is not standing in the glass. 
After the game starts **all the glasses are fadded and a lava pool appears** under you, if you fall, you lose. 
The blocks are going to fade each **5 seconds**, take care because it is random. 
I wish you good luck!  
**It is going to be challenger!**
